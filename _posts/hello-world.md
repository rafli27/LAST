Hello world, this is the first post from [UnQuez](http://unquez.com). This is just a sign that we want to try to start a business with our small team. We do business in the field of software development.

This team was formed from our friendship communication during college. [UnQuez](http://unquez.com) was formed on 5 March 2018 as a replacement for our old team name Owlcode Media, with new members and new passion. Actually we have 2 times changed the team name. Our first team was named "Algorithm Made By Me", the name is in stretcher by Rizki Munandar who is currently still part of the team of [UnQuez](http://unquez.com) developers. Then our name changed to "Owlcode Media", it's so funny. Because this name is taken because of our activities that always start at night. Both names were formed during our college days.

After we finish college, our team very rarely meet, because of their busyness. Then Yusril Herlian Syah, who is currently part of a team of developers at [UnQuez](http://unquez.com), rebuilt the team with the name [UnQuez](http://unquez.com).

The [UnQuez](http://unquez.com) name is taken from two English words namely "unique" and "quest". Currently we still do not have a place to be the headquarters of [UnQuez](http://unquez.com). But we still communicate with Slack and Whatsapp. And for the current project we do remotely.
